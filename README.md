# Coursera-Capstone-Project
(This is the capstone project for IBM data science professional courses)  
(_find Presentation slide [here](https://github.com/yuyongze/coursera-capstone-project/blob/master/Coursera-Capstone-Project.pdf)_)

In this project we will focus on using the location data to explore interesting problems in real word!

## Introduction/Business Problem
Let say if you are a buisiness manerger who want to invest a *Chinese restaruant* in your resident city. You are live in the mid-size city which has fast growth. You have to decide where or which **neighberhoods** to open the restaruant.  
In order to answer this question, you have to build a model get some recommendations where to start your business.   
+ Therefore, we will learn a model from a mature city/metropolitan city since we believe that it is more develeped. Your city will become a metropolis some day.
+ Another thing you believe is that any one of business venue does not exist alone,and "Chinese restaruant" always tends to be find with some other type of shops,because neighberhoods have "cultures" to like them both.
### Solution
  Therefore, we will use **Regression** method to learn and predict number of the *Chinese restaruant* in a neighberhood by providing the venues information of **Toronto** City. Venues information is discoverd from [Foursquare](https://foursquare.com/) API. 
- [explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto](https://github.com/yuyongze2014/coursera-capstone-project/blob/master/explore%20and%20cluster%20the%20neighborhoods%20in%20Toronto.ipynb)
- [explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto2](https://github.com/yuyongze2014/coursera-capstone-project/blob/master/explore%20and%20cluster%20the%20neighborhoods%20in%20Toronto2.ipynb)
-  [explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto3](https://github.com/yuyongze2014/coursera-capstone-project/blob/master/explore%20and%20cluster%20the%20neighborhoods%20in%20Toronto2.ipynb)

Then, you will you the build model to pridict the number of *Chinese restaruant* in your city and compare with exiting number of *Chinese restaruant*. And a potaitial place to start your business!


#### Pick a city
In this project, we will us *Columbus,OH* as example, to see how we can achieve it.
Neighborhoods infomation is get from [city-data.com](http://www.city-data.com/nbmaps/neigh-Columbus-Ohio.html)
